Business model assumes that for retail, especially in food and beverage, realtime/dynamic controls that link together sub-controls/systems that manage supply/inventory, models for demand and pricing, and point-of-sales data can provide for rapid and realtime optimization of the objective function of max profit by realtime/dynamic variable pricing.  Real IP consists of models for demand and pricing which should be unique past some common point, especially amongst small/single retail stores, and the optimization solution across the specified constraints coming from demand and pricing models to the max profit objective function.
